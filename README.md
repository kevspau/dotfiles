my dotfiles for endeavoros(i3)


WM: i3
Terminal: kitty
Shell: fish

my first config! pretty basic but i like it.
most themes are catppuccin based, and dunst has the dracula theme

make sure to have
1. a nerd font installed
2. quicksand font installed
3. [starship prompt](https://starship.rs/) for fish
